# WeekendOff
You are working from home and having to quit Teams and other work-related softs is too annoying? Here is the solution!

Weekend Off will kill these apps on the weekend only (or any day you like).

Download the latest release and create a link to the executable here: %userprofile%/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup

You will be free on the weekend now!

You can customize the days and hours of work.
